# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Andrei Ionita
Minute taker: Tudor Coman

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The team had a new chair and a new note-taker, hooray!

#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent!

Feedback: The agenda followed the template and had a clear structure and the topics included were relevant. The agenda was also added on GitLab well ahead of the meeting. Nothing else to add :D!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The notes have been posted on GitLab. The amount of notes is good, and the taken notes are clear and easy to read. The notes contain concrete agreements, and these are actionable and realistic. I liked that you wrote full sentences, I believe it would be better to have a list of summarised points, instead of a long sentence. It is sometimes easy to lose patience when reading a long sentence ;).


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good!

Feedback: The chair ensured that all topics in the agenda were covered. Each topic received enough time. I would have liked it if you lead the discussion more.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: I appreciated that this week most of you were involved actively in the discussion and in the meeting itself. The team took ownership of the meeting. The overall atmosphere was constructive. Everyone's ideas were listened to.


#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Sufficient!

Feedback: The team presented me with the current state of their application. The application was pottentially shippable. There is some progress compared to week 4. However, the progress was not significant. There are less than 3 weeks until the end of the project, and 4 of the people in the team are under performing. The team is currently not on a good track to create a working application until the end of the project.
