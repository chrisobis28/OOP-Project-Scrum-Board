# Week 2

## Formative Assessment

- **Chair**: Chris Obis
- **Notetaker**: Andrei Ioniță


#### Meeting Organization

Mark: Pass!

Feedback: The meeting had both a chairman and a note-taker. Everyone arrived on time, well done!

#### Agenda 

Feedback: Good! The agenda was really well done and was also sent ahead of the meeting. I believed it contained relevant topics and each one was described well. This brings me to my next point, I think the topics was described too thoroughly, which makes it a bit more tedious for the others to read. The point is the others, should be able to skim through the bullet points and quickly get an idea of what is going to be discussed in the meeting. Your effort is still appreciated! :)

#### Chair performance

Feedback: Excellent! The chair covered every topic in the agenda in a clear, linear manner. The chair also lead the discussion with a really friendly tone right away, and it was clear that it contributed a lot to how well the meeting went. The chair also knew when to listen, and when to take action to lead the discussion. Well done!

#### Time management

Feedback: Good! There was enough time for all the topics, but most topics seemed a bit rushed. I believe you could have spent more time discussing some topics.

#### Minute taker performance

Feedback: Excellent! There is a nice amount of relevant notes, in a tidy format. The notes also contain team agreements, actions and assigned people. Well done!

#### Relation

Feedback: Sufficient! I believe the atmosphere was great and friendly, and everyone was listened to and had enough space to talk. However, some of you did not contribute at all, or way less than what I would have liked. Remember, everyone should speak up, and if you're not doing that, please start doing so, your ideas matter.
