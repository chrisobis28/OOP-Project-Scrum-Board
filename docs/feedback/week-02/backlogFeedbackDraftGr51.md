### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The backlog has been uploaded as a pdf under the docs folder.

### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The structure of the backlog is quite clear as it contains the reference to the mock-ups at the end, the terminology and then the prioritised list of tasks. It would have been better to also include the stakeholders in the beginning, as you have been instructed in the assignment. The level of detail in each of the sections is good. The languaged used is easy to follow and does not contain many typos.


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You have made use of the MoSCoW method, please use epics instead. That would mean you will have a list of epics(which couple together related features), with the first epic in the list would be the most important. Remember you still need an epic for a basic application. Remember also that epics should have a sufficient introduction that clarifies the feature. I would recommend following the assignment question closer.

### User Stories

Mark: Sufficient!

Feedback: The user stories do not follow the correct format. Remember that a user story must follow the following format:  I as *role* want to *requirement* so I can *reason*. Your user stories do not include the "I can *reason*" part. The user stories do have a clear focus on the user perspective and they describe an individual workflow. Each section has a good amount of user stories, and thus the backlog is quite complete. The backlog does not contain contradicting requirements.

### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: Every user story is concise and their effect is clear as a consequence. Thus the acceptance criteria is implicit. Reason about adding acceptance criteria where it is not that obvious how a certain requirement would be fulfilled.
