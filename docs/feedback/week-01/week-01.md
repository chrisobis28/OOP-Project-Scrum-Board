#### 1) Self-organization : Good!
	The discussion was quite friendly, everyone contributed to it and there was a positive atmosphere all around, good job! I believe you can still improve on how you interact with eachother. For instance, your teammates might know the answer for a question, so you could raise the question to them first, and if nobody can answer it, you could redirect the question to me. You should help eachother out if you can :D


#### 2) Suggested Topics : Good!

	This was our first meeting, so you're just starting to know how the meetings are supposed to be handled, so it is perfectly fine for now. From next week onwards, the chairman should lead the discussion based on the agenda, and everyone should be engaged in the meeting. The Teamwork lecture should be your reference if you have any concerns. Remember to send the agenda to the others so they will be on board with the topics to be discussed.
