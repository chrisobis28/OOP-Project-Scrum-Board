# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Secuiu Stefan Maniu
Minute taker: Ã“bis Chris (improvised, instead of Tudor Coman)

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The team has a new chair and a new minute taker, hooray!

#### Agenda 

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The agenda was sent well ahead of time on both Mattermost and GitLab. The agenda followed the template and had a very good structure. I really liked how each section was described by multiple bullet points, it made everything clear and easy to go through. I liked that the agenda was thorough, but be careful with the amount of topics you have, as with the amount of topics you had, it might be tough to fit everything in the time.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The notes were posted on gitlab, which is good. The amount of notes taken was very good, and the separation into agenda items was very helpful for the reader. I liked that you summarised the core of each topic that was discussed and the most important conclusions. The notes contained concrete agreements such as changing the user stories according to the feedback. The agreements made were actionable and realistic. I would recommend also noting down which person a certain task is assigned to, as for now tasks were assigned collectively on the notes ("we need to change"). You did assign a task to a person once, but it might be helpful to do it more often after a person is assigned a task.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The chair really took the lead of the discussion, which made the meeting very well structured and coherent. All topics in the agenda were covered, and they were given enough time. I also liked the tone used by the chair, and how the chair tried to engage with the others, but also to motivate everyone. I also appreciated how you handled the situation with the person being late.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: I was really impressed by the improvement of everyone's attitude towards the meeting, well done! I liked that the team reflected on the feedback provided one week ago, and it really showed that the team listened to my feedback. The meeting had a friendly and open tone, and everyone contributed to the discussion in a warm manner. The atmosphere was constructive as consensus has been reached on multiple topics. About being late to the meeting, that's not the most respectful thing of course. Please try to make it on time.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You have not shown me your current state of the application! Please make sure to do this in the following meetings, as it will be really important for me to see this, so I can track your weekly progress. In that way, I can also give you more valuable feedback and to tell you if you are on track to finish the project successfully.
