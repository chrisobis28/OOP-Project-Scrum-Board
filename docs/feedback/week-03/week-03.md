#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Jastrzemski Tymon
Minute taker: Liberadzki Marcin

Mark: Pass

Feedback: The team had a new chair and a new minute taker, hooray!


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent!

Feedback: The agenda was sent on mattermost, and was posted on gitlab well ahead of the meeting, well done! The agenda followed the template and contained a very clear list of points, with different "sub-topics" which I found quite useful. Great job!


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: None.

Feedback: This week's minute taker will receive feedback next week!

#### Chair performance

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The chair lead the discussion with a friendly tone, and stuck to the agenda closely. Each subject received enough time in the discussion. What I also found quite good, is that the chair looked over the feedback given for last week, and made a few "motivational" remarks to improve the quality of the meetings. 


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Very good!

Feedback: The atmosphere in the meeting was very friendly and open, and the team took complete ownership over the meeting, well done! I felt that everyone was on the same page, and the discussion flowed very well. Everyone's ideas were taken into account which was great. My advice for future meetings would be to close down your laptops if you don't need them, or put away phones, as it seemed to distract your attention sometimes.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: You did not present the current state of your application. This should start happening already next week, so I can start to observe some progress.
