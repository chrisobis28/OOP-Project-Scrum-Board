# Talio

## Description of project

Talio is an application similar to a Scrum board on which a team can organize post-it notes that describe the 
contents of a sprint. Users can work together on a board to split up their work on different lists. Lists can 
contain multiple cards that describe the job that need to be completed for a list. With these cards, users can 
easily break down projects into manageable issues that can be assigned to the members of a team.
